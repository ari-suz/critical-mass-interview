# Ariana Jorgensen for Critical Mass
## Technical Interview (take-home)

### Notes:
* I used VSCode & LiveServer (extension) to run the code. This bypassed the CORS error when importing/reading the JSON file
* To display the time for each city, I created a file almost identical to navigation.json, replcaing the 'label' key/value pair with 'timezone', to help with calculating the correct time for a given city
